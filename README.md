### II. Goals : 
- Build machine learning to predict house prices in beijing

### III. Work Steps : 
- <b> Data Preparation :
   - Peforming Columns I Check (Checking Column and Column related Data)
   - Converting Categorical Numeric Values to Strings.
   - Fill in the missing values
   - Performing Column II Check (Checking Column Data Types) Because there is data missing, so there are several columns whose data types cannot be changed, therefore I checked and changed them again.

- <b> Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - Territorial and population information
  - Correlation of Other Columns with Column Target (TotalPrice) / subject that affects the price
  
- <b> Modelling
  - In this modeling, two jobs are carried out, namely data with outliers and data without outliers, and using 5 machine learning algorithms along with hyperparameter tuning. At the time of tuning I had problems, namely low computer specs, and Google Colab which was always an error due to the many tuning parameters and data, so I divided the random forest tuning into 3 parts. 
  - Machine Learning 1 Notebook files are machine learning files with outlier data, and Machine Learning 2 files are machine learning files whose outlier data is deleted.
